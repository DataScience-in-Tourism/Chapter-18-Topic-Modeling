Cruise like a local — Morning boat cruise Amsterdam — Be The Only One on the Amsterdam Canals"
2;3;Amsterdam;"*PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A FREE TOUR CONCEPT*
(1 euro is to ensure your spot for airbnb booking fee) :)

Everyone does tours about the Pilgrim Fathers in Leiden but everyone forgets about FOUNDING Father John Adams' time here! His mission to the Netherlands to secure a Dutch loan during the American Revolution is one of the most significant and forgotten about chapters in the war and Leiden was undoubtedly his favorite city. The loan that he secured helped save the United States in its infancy!

Join me on a stroll through the Leiden of 1780 and discover the places Adams stayed, his place of worship, his sons' residence (one of them being the 6th President of the United States!) and the houses of his dearest friends and allies. We will also learn about his connection to the Pilgrim Fathers as well as other major sites."

4)	Preparing the sugar syrup. In your perfect waffle, you need the perfect (in Dutch: stroop) syrup. We’ll cook it shortly with real Madagaskar Bourbon vanilla and cinnamon to the perfect temperature of 45 degrees celsius.
5)	Bake it! With our dedicated waffle iron, you bake 7 stroopwaffles, finish them with your own made syrup and your Dutch stroopwaffle is ready to eat. 

We do not provide a gluten-free version.

During our workshop you will learn, discover, but especially have lots of fun.

Fun fact:

Did you know The Dutch have a rich tradition of drinking beer. Around 1700 it was considered healthier (and safer) to drink beer instead than water? While the dough is rising, we’ll present you a small beer tasting."

It helps when you a rough idea of what you want to make. I also have a website with a lot of pictures of the jewellery that other people made. 
Handy to get a bit of inspiration of what can be done in two hours :-)

I'll show you how to solder with silver solder. 

The last step will be a nice polish for some sparkle.

About halfway, I offer you lunch and drinks at my home which gives you the opportunity to recover for the second half of the tour, ask any questions you would like and learn a little about life in The Hague.

Via the dike you reach Zaandijk. Here you'll see original workers' houses and merchant houses and you'll get explanations about the houses. On the other side of the Zaan is the Zaanse Schans a tourist hotspot with 6 windmills, original 18th century houses and old crafts, including a clog factory and a cheese dairy.

I'll pick you up near Alkmaar’s town square in a 1930 vintage boat: one of the only boats able to fit under the uniquely low bridges of the surrounding canals. We’ll take a 30 min. cruise through Alkmaar, ducking under the bridges and seeing the sights from the most beautiful angle available. I’ll share tips and stories from a local’s perspective. We will then arrive at the mill where you’ll enjoy refreshments, nature, animals, and a tour of the working mill. You’ll also get a peek back in time on the 3rd floor museum, full of treasures from the region’s rich history.

Luego entraremos de lleno en el Jordaan, mi barrio favorito del Centro. Allí te enseñaré sitios especiales del barrio, en esquinas y patios y te explicaré por qué el Jordaan tiene el encanto que tiene.

Como cerca del Jordaan está la Casa de Ana Frank, si no has tenido la oportunidad de visitarla, podemos hacer una parada y te cuento cómo se vive actualmente el tema de la Segunda Guerra Mundial en la ciudad.

Después, pedaleamos hacia Vondelpark, pero antes me gustaría enseñarte mi barrio, Oud-West, el barrio más de moda de Amsterdam pero que no siempre fue así de valorado.

Y al ladito, entraremos a Vondelpark. No puedo ni describirlo con palabras, es sensacional poder pasearlo en bici, sensacional!

Después una de las sorpresas que tiene Amsterdam: el barrio rico, donde está además, la Plaza de los Museos. Un imponente espacio para hacer una superfoto!

Y por supuesto, si a lo largo del tour nos apetece un cafetito, tarta de manzana o unas bitterballen, hacemos parada en la cafetería que más me gusta de mi barrio o si hay mercadillo ese día, podemos ir a probar quesos holandeses (como hispanohablante, valoro mucho la comida y sé dónde está lo realmente bueno ;)"

51;52;Amsterdam;"Join me for an individual body and mind treatment! It is also possible to book it with a friend (see private group, maximum 2/write me for 3, each person more means 20 minutes treatment more). 
I'll welcome you in my house in a unique space of Amsterdams' nature, just a 15 minutes metroride from Waterlooplein (center). You will be amazed by the nature so close to the center.
We'll start with a cup of herbal tea to warm up the heart & body. We will briefly introduce ourselves and I’ll ask some questions about you in order to have some preliminary information which will help me during the treatment. The first part consists of some meditation, breath inhalation, body exercises or stillness, the second part is the massage. 
Massages are done on the skin but it is also possible with clothes on. I use essential oils to elevate your experience. We will end the session with a cup of tea and a healthy snack.

Success as an entrepreneur carries with it the hidden risk of serious pain and suffering resulting from poor health, overwork, and stress. 
 
I am the perfect example. As one of the Netherlands' best known and most successful entrepreneurs, I nearly lost it all to a complete physical, mental, and emotional breakdown. After nine months of painful recovery, I survived and made it my mission to help fellow entrepreneurs avoid the same fate. My goal is to prove that entrepreneurs can have it all while living a fulfilling, healthy, and balanced personal life.

Let’s take a walk in the Vondelpark in Amsterdam. I’ll answer your questions and guide you through the Five Facets of Sustainable Entrepreneurship as described in my book Redesign and how to use them to either reinvigorate your career or cure the illness of burnout.

Some of the greatest visionaries of our time - Steve Jobs, Richard Branson, and even Barack Obama - were fans of walking meetings, and it looks like they were onto something. According to a Stanford University study, a person's creative output increased by 60% when they were walking. If that's not motivation to get up off your chair and take a walk in the Vondelpark with me, I don't know what is. Book this experience today!"

Similar to metal detecting where objects are found on land using a metal detector, magnet fishing is about finding metal objects in water using strong magnets. Have you always imagined what could be at the bottom of a lake near where you live?

Magnet fishing in our canals is one of the greatest outdoor experiences one can have. To throw out your magnet and to see what you pull out feels so exciting. It is unbelievable what metal objects you dig up from our canals. Keys, jewels, warattributes, pistols, knives, axes, parts of bikes, cars, you name it, I saw it getting dragged out of our waters.
We will meet in the centre near one of our famous bridges and I will talk you trough our beautiful history while I hand you all a strong magnet with a rope attached, we trow out our magnets and we're off!

But there were also people that served in the 'palaces' at the Herengracht, worked in one of the hundred or more mills that ground corn, sugar and coffee or that built the ships that sailed to the West and East Indies.
This boat tour shows both sides of Amsterdam, the wealth of the Herengracht but also the modest houses along the Lauriersgracht in the working class district 'the Jordaan'.  Hans - MA in history- will tell you everything about low and high life in the 17th and 18th century, the poverty of the industrial revolution and the 'Jordaan rebellion' of 1934.

You arrive at my home at 14h. 

I offer you some refreshments like coffee, tea, juice and water. After a brief introduction and settling at the work table, we are ready to start. 

I will give you some guidance and tools that you will use as a base, but creativity is all yours to unfold. The focus will be on the relationship between shapes and colors.

The art you create will be inspired by abstract expressionism; and trust me when I say, YOU do not need any art background for this class. It’s even better if you have none. 

During our class, you can ask me any questions, or advice on how to use paint, brush, how to mix colors, etc. 
I will also teach you the basics of color wheel scheme. Super fun! 
 
What will you gain in this art class?

-Some of my previous students often gave me feedback on how curious they started to feel as they dived into the assignment. It felt relaxing, mindful, and exciting. 

-You do get to keep your masterpiece after the class is over! 

-You will learn a bit about color wheel and mixing colors, relationship between shapes and colors, intentional/unintentional abstract expression. 

We end at 17h (possible 15 minutes over) and take group photo."

257;258;Amsterdam;"Все начинается  у старых врат города, именно там находилась старая гавать и там началась история квартала Де Вален и именно оттуда мы начнём наше вечернее путешествие. Мы заглянем в церковь святого Николая, которая являлась последним и самым первым местом, куда моряки приходили просить благословения перед далеким плаванье и благодарить Бога за то, что сохранил их, по возвращению. Мы узнаем чьим ещё покровителем является святой Николай именно в Амстердаме и каким образом художники отошли от религиозных канонов, когда оформляли внутреннее убранство святыни. Далее наш путь лежит в место, с которым связано много легенд и даже крылатое выражение в современном нидерландском языке - один из двух уцелевших деревянных домов ""обезьянок"". Мы поговорим о ""тайных церквях"" и о иконоборческих войнах, которыми просто пронизана вся история королевства тюльпанов, постараемся угадать за какими именно стенами они расположены и по сей день. Мы узнаем за какой подвиг получила свою награду Маргарет Босхардт и как эта странная бабушка на скамейке связана с кварталом красных фонарей. В рамках нашей экскурсии мы посетим самую узкую улицу квартала и ""бархатный"" квадрат, поговорим о легендах, связанных с появлением аж двух памятников представительницам древней профессии, мы поговорим об истории театра ""Casa rossa"" и о том как формируется ""доска почёта"" в Light Red secret и еще много самого интересного"
258;259;Amsterdam;"Nella nostra passeggiata di circa 2 ore andremo alla scoperta della storia di Amsterdam e della sua cultura. 
Ti parlerò non sono si quelli che sono i luoghi principali della città ma anche di tutto ciò che non è scritto all'interno delle guide cartacee su Amsterdam. Tutte le informazioni che fanno parte della mia quotidianità in città e della cultura olandese che ho imparato a conoscere e apprezzare durante la mia vita ad Amsterdam. Ad esempio: gli olandesi sono davvero un popolo accogliente e tollerante? Come mai hanno totalmente stravolto la loro quotidinità fino ad eliminare l'utilizzo dell'auto e scegliere la bicicletta?

Raggiungeremo la zona dei canali patrimonio unesco, una delle mie zone preferite dove collezionare ricordi e fotografie indimenticabili, passeremmo tra i vicoli e le case storte di Amsterdam fino ad arrivare ad una delle piazza più interessanti di Amsterdam Spui dove poterci fermare per ammirare uno degli angoli più segreti di Amsterdam e rimanere a bocca aperta."

261;262;Amsterdam;"What is Gezellig? (H-e-z-e-l-e-e-h) 
On this tour, you will experience a very Dutch concept of Gezellig - the essential ingredient to having a good, well spent time. Gezellig is a feeling, a way of living, a lifestyle that I practice daily ;) To understand what it is - we'll explore my home neighbourhood Jordaan - one of the oldest and most authentic, non-touristy areas of Amsterdam. I'll take you to hidden inner yards and residential streets where you can peek into people's windows (we keep our curtains open for you to look!) and learn what a real Dutch lifestyle and house decor is all about. You will learn about the crucial ingredients of living the Gezellig life, the Dutch way. We will also visit a family own antique toy store where you will discover a handmade world created from scratch by its lovely owner.
During our walk, we'll have a break with a yummy snack at a very old, traditional cafe. I'll entertain you with insider stories and anecdotes (that I collected over the years from the locals) about various places in Jordaan - something you won't read on the internet!
At the end of this tour, you will surely know, and most importantly feel what Gezellig is. You might even take it home and practice it with your friends and family :)"
262;263;Amsterdam;"We will be spending most of our time in the historical core of the city, within the canal belt. Beginning in Dam Square, which in itself has many stories to tell, we then head just a few minutes away to the oldest city neighbourhood, The Wallen, better known as the Red Light district. This is a fascinating area during the day also, even besides its most obvious attractions. Nowhere in Amsterdam is History so richly layered. From it's lovely churches to the famous 'windows', life in Amsterdam cannot be explained without an understanding of how this area came to prominence.

We then walk through Chinatown to the Nieuwmarkt, where Rembrandt's Painters Guild still stands. And, since it borders the old Jewish Quarter, delve into the rich Jewish history of this city. We go by the Old headquarters of the Dutch East Indies Company, which in its own way explains a little bit of what makes the dutch so Dutch. We take a coffee break near the Cannabis museum. At a normal coffeehouse! Not one of Amsterdam's famous 'Coffeeshops'. But I do explain all about Hollands soft drugs policies."

266;267;Amsterdam;L'itinerario è dedicato a tutti coloro che vogliono scoprire l'essenza del cuore pulsante di Amsterdam. Toccheremo con mano il centro storico della città dove si fonde la capitale moderna e il suo cuore medievale. Il giro parte dalla famosa piazza Dam, si articola toccando De Papegaai, una chiesa segreta nascosta tra le vie dello shopping. Proseguiremo ammirando la facciata dell'Amsterdam Museum, l'ex convento Begijnhof, che ha ancora oggi uno spirito soprannaturale, la Chiesa inglese e la Begijnhofkapel, chiesa clandestina che sembra una normale abitazione. Continueremo visitando la più antica casa della città risalente al 1470 e chiusa al pubblico, l'Università di Amsterdam, la strada santa e Rasphuis, dove sorgeva il carcere seicentesco. Ammireremo il famoso Bloemenmarkt, il mercato dei fiori galleggiante unico al mondo e ti narrerò la sua nascita e le curiosità sulla sua trasformazione. Concluderemo il giro ammirando la Torre della zecca, la Colonna del Miracolo, per poi rientrare a piazza Dam. L'idea è fornirti un itinerario completo e dettagliato sul centro città, approfondendo tutti quei luoghi poco conosciuti ai turisti che rappresentano però l'essenza di Amsterdam.

272;273;Amsterdam;"There is no better way to experience Amsterdam than by cycling around.  Windmills, canals, dykes, cheese, clogs. and a visit to a cow farm are all part of this tour. A befriended tour guide (15+ years experience) helped me construct this experience. 

This tour starts at Museumplein, in the heart of the city. From there, we continue into the Vondelpark to get acquainted with riding your bike. In the park, you’ll immediately feel the summer vibe that will have encapsulated the city. We exit the park and ride along a quiet river on our way to the Amsterdam Forest. On our way we stop to see how the Dutch manage their inland shipping through a genius lock system and see a local community of houseboats. 

We continue our journey into the park where we ride along the rowing lake. We cruise through the trees and exit onto a ‘dyke’. We then bike under the water level through a reclaimed piece of land called a ‘polder’ and we stop at a pumping station that keeps the area from flowing over.
Next, we follow the river Amstel upstream. We stop at a local farm where you’ll get to pet the cows and taste some local cheese. To complete the Dutch Culture Bingo Card, we stop at a nearby windmill.  This part of the country-side is so beautiful, Rembrandt was known to have made a lot of his sketches right there!

317;318;Amsterdam;"Before world famous Dutch painter Piet Mondrian moved to New York and produced his mindblowing abstract works like Victory Boogy Woogie, he lived and worked in Amsterdam for almost twenty years (1892 - 1911). Whenever he needed to escape the city, he often cycled along the curves of the idyllic river ‘Gein’. On these roamings, he produced dozens of paintings of the Oostzijdse windmill and farms and trees along the river Gein, one of them famously known as ‘Mill in Sunlight’. 

I will take you along the scenic Gein river in Piet’s footsteps on a unique Mondrian-tour under the Dutch skies. We will visit the still existing spots which stood at the cradle of this passionate and great artist and which influenced his work significantly. We will escape the city and submerse ourselves in the rural tranquility like Mondrian did and absorb the natural beauty of the still present Dutch landscape elements which inspired him to sketch and paint farms and mills with so much joy, fantasy and passion.  

On our way we will have tea or coffee with 'stroopwafel' opposite the café where Mondrian used to have drinks with his friends. Here I will share anecdotes about his life, friends, spiritual path and his unique thoughts about art.

15;368;Athens;"What about a special excursion off the beaten path in the heart of Greece's 2nd largest island!

Dirfi is a majestic mountain hosting rich biodiversity and mysterious fog clouds in the center of Evia island. Also recognized as a gem for mushroom hunting (seasonally)!

Our journey will start just outside the picturesque village of Steni through a dense forest(part of Natura) rich in chestnuts, firs, oaks, plane trees, ferns but also small mammals, various birds and amphibians. 

The uphill trek starts next to an idyllic river, crosses the best part of the fir forest and ends at the local refuge.There you can breath the fresh cool air from the Aegean sea and admire the cone of Dirfi and the surrounding peaks.

After a short rest we start our descent from a different terrain, traversing a rocky garden for a short while, overlooking the village and south towards other alpine peaks.Finally we cross the pine forest with the smell of resin gushing around us!

During the trek we make many breaks for refreshment and try to introduce you to local customs and culture.

In Steni we can enjoy a walk in the small alleyways & find hand collected herbs!

The whole hiking route (~10km,+700m) has a moderate difficulty with small challenging but enjoyable parts.

On the way back we can stop at a mushroom station and learn more about the fungi kingdom!

50;403;Athens;"At CookinAthens you will learn how to cook a proper Greek meal in an atmosphere that feels like home. The classes are totally hands-on and all the recipes will be given to you in writing in advance so you can take notes during the class . 
Once we’ve all gotten to know each other, we will talk about the menu and the steps for every recipe we are going to cook. You will learn how to cook a 4- course dinner to resemble a common Greek lunch/dinner using the best local ingredients and following traditional family recipes, (sometimes with a twist) which we will all devour afterwards while talking, laughing and drinking good Greek wine.
To ensure all class participants learn the most important parts of the given menu, certain key techniques (such as making dough for pies from scratch) will be executed by all class participants. By the end of the class our guests will be able to recreate the full menu when they get back home.
A sample menu includes a spanakopita (spinach pie) or cheesepie, a tzatziki (yogurt spread with garlic and dill), Greek salad (which we make our way), pastitsio (the greek lasagna)  or Moussaka (both made with a family recipe)  or chicken in tomato sauce and handmade pasta) and for dessert Frigania from Zante (Rusk soaked in syrup, topped with pastry cream or ravani (semolina cake soaked in syrup). the dinner will be finished with traditional Greek spirits."
51;404;Athens;"In ancient Greek history, there was a deep bond between humans and animals. They became symbols, children's toys and played central roles in fairy tales. In mythology, human souls were trapped inside animals under the curse of the gods. Many ancient Greek artists used copper, marble, clay and gold to illustrate these minimal and, at the same time, perfect animal forms. As one of the admirers of this type of art, I would like to invite you on a journey to this magical world through the art of clay sculpture. 

The workshop will start with a brief reference to the animals and their symbolism in ancient Greece. Then, I will show you my way to create animal forms. You can eventually make your own animal creature and take it back home. The clay animal needs to dry and be fired in the kiln. You can receive it afterwards  from the lab or post it to your  home address (with an additional cost).  

A certificate of participation will be offered to each participant by the end of the workshop.

The 1-hour workshop takes place every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at 11.00 o'clock and 16.30 in my lab and shop, ""Evdokia Tziveleki"", Parthenonos 28, 11742 Athens, under the sacred rock of the Acropolis.

270;623;Athens;"In 1834 King Otto decided to move the capital of his newly acquired kingdom from Nafplio to Athens. His selection was based on emotion rather than reason, since Athens was little more than a pile of ruins covered in weeds. The few residents had to struggle daily against the dust, the lack of drinkable water, and malaria. The complete absence of infrastructure was accompanied by a serious lack of housing to accommodate the royal household, the government, the army or the civil servants.

Otto and his ministers arrived during a cold and damp winter. They occupied all the available buildings in town and embarked on a grand project of creating a capital out of nothing. A university, an observatory, a military and a civil hospital, as well as a palace (that resembled a barracks or a madhouse) were built in record time. However, no money or effort was expended on schools, ministries, public lighting, sidewalks or sewers.

During this two-hour walk in downtown Athens we will observe the transformation of an Ottoman village into a European metropolis. We will become acquainted with the leading figures of the period, we will visit the sites of seminal events during the reign of King Otto, and we will “meet” the women of Athens who welcomed guests by offering homemade spinach pie and halva."

Then we will continue towards Philopappou Hill and up to our next point, the Hill of Pnyx a place where the great ancient philosophers gave their speeches with a view towards Acropolis. We will traverse through ancient Dimos Melitis and a little further up we will be greeted from the Hill of the Muses. There we will enjoy a panoramic view of the city, 360o degrees. We will descend the Muses Hill from an unknown route and we will pass by Socrates Prison. Further on we will reach the pedestrian street of Dionysiou Areopagitou and pass by the Odeon of Herodes Atticus and the New Museum of Acropolis. Our next stop will be the Temple of Olympian Zeus with Hadrian's Arch. We will finish our route with stretching  in the courtyard of Zappeio.

279;632;Athens;Eleusis is bedraggled, whimsical, exciting, mysterious and romantic in a postmodern way. It has an abundance of classical and Roman monuments, neoclassical mansions, a sleepy railway station that no train ever visits, and enough factories in a state of ruinous disrepair to compose an unforgettable hymn to industrial decay. As Eleusis prepares to become the 2021 European Capital of Culture, there is a tangible sense of renewal and excitement in the air as the city is fast becoming a must-see destination. The saint who offered his seat to a goddess, the dictator who saved his hometown, the seaman who initiated a coup because he was too lazy to type, the housewife who planted rose bushes to prove her upper class upbringing, and the islanders who established an earthly heaven in the shadow of a bunch of industrial chimneys are the heroes of this walk. We will explore the elements that endow Eleusis with its unique charm: the large factories that brought much wealth and much pain to this place, the neoclassical residences that became status symbols for a new group of factory managers and directors, the picturesque neighbourhoods established almost overnight by the refugees, and the remains of the city’s glorious classical and Roman past. This is Eleusis in a nutshell, a community that used nature’s bounty and man’s vision to create a city unlike any other in Greece.
280;633;Athens;"Our unique trip starts from Syntagma Square. A comfortable minibus will be waiting for you. I will tell you about all the interesting places that we will drive through. The first stop is in Thermopylae, where in 480 BC. e. a small detachment of warriors of the Spartan king Leonid successfully confronted the two-hundred-thousand-strong army of the Persians Xerxes for several days. We will visit the museum and the monument to King Leonid.
The second stop is
magical, mystical, impressive, unusual, exciting, huge, inspiring Meteora Monasteries (almost 400km from Athens) - the largest complex of monasteries in Greece. They were built in impossible conditions. Lack of roads, at least some construction equipment and horses. All materials were brought and raised to the rocks by hand, baskets and nets. I know the road where you don’t have to go on foot - we will drive by car to the monasteries themselves!
We will visit two of the most beautiful monasteries,  this is the Great Meteora Monastery and the Monastery of St. Varlaam! We will make fantastic photos and videos at an altitude of 650 m above the Thessaly Valley from a breathtaking panoramic platform. After exploring the Meteora, we will go down to the town of Kastraki for dinner + buying souvenirs in a Greek  shop. This is an unforgettable journey!"

288;641;Athens;The eye of a visitor is often keen and penetrating, able to detect what is best and most beautiful, as well as absurd and bizarre. In the 1840s, as Athens expanded rapidly to become the “Paris of the East”, Hans Christian Andersen arrived in Thiseio and began exploring a city enveloped in myths and classical stories. His ultimate goal was to meet the king and queen, a social  event that became a small odyssey before Andersen managed to enter the throne room. This experience is a journey through time as we follow in the footsteps of the famous Danish storyteller and discover the most vibrant and colourful neighbourhoods of Athens.
289;642;Athens;"Astrological History-Mystery Tour of Ancient Athens.

Discover the gods and goddesses that rule your personal astrological chart and visit their shrines.

When Classical Greece was in its heyday astrology played a pivotal role.  It was considered a science and a natural part of daily life.  Join me for a walk around some of the important sites in central Athens to explore how the astrology we know today came from the sages of ancient Greece, who had a much fuller, practical, balanced and egalitarian way of looking at the Zodiac than we do today  I am a professional astrologer with a special interest in the Greek astrologer/astronomers/philosophers.  

We will meet in the square in Thission.  We'll  introduce ourselves and then walk and talk within an area of less than a square kilometre for an hour and a half.  Then we’ll go to a quiet spot for refreshments and conversation.  We will take our time and enjoy meeting each other.  If people want a break midway we can do that too.

Places are limited to 6 participants so that there is ample space for interaction. And don't worry, you don’t have to be an astrologer to take part in this experience.  If you've ever wished you had time to delve deeper than magazine horoscopes into this ancient art this is a great opportunity.

You will explore Anafiotika, an island-looking quarter created almost overnight (since it was actually illegal to erect new houses here) by stonemasons from Anafi, who came to Athens in search of work in the booming building industry of King Otto’s time. You will admire impressive neoclassical masterpieces and come to understand the process whereby the Athenians discarded their Ottoman past in favour of a European future. If you look closely, you may still discover old Turkish homes hiding in plain sight. 

But in Plaka you can go even further back in time. There are Byzantine churches from the period when the city was famous for the beauty of its inhabitants and provided queens and princesses to the imperial throne in Constantinople. There are water clocks that became schools and choragic monuments that served as libraries and dormitories for famous English poets and dandies. There are romantic bathhouses that remained in use for centuries and prisons that allowed inmates to go out for coffee before executing them from the branches of a plane tree. Plaka is a hodgepodge of history and visual stimuli that preserves what is best about Athens and enchants all visitor"

47;719;Berlin;"Berlin is creative & sexy city and this workshop will get you prepared for the vibe as you create your own high-quality custom leather cuffs - get ready for a fun crafting experience and a fabulous handmade take-home souvenir for yourself, a friend or a lover!

Using real leather and stylish metal hardware (rivets, d-rings, buckles etc.), we will make a custom set of fetish/fashion cuffs using leather hand working tools. 

We'll start with a welcome introduction, a glass of bubbly, and a little tour of my rooftop loft where we'll be creating. Following this, I'll give you a brief explanation and overview of what we'll be working with - the leather, the metal, and the tools. Then we'll get to work!

You'll use many leather hand working techniques including punching, cutting, beveling, burnishing, slicking and polishing. You'll love the smell and the feel of the leather in your hands. It's a satisfying process that mixes both soft techniques (polishing and burnishing) and quite forceful techniques (such as the cutting and punching) to craft a very personal object.

('Sexy' applies to the object you are crafting not the workshop. You can opt-out if for any reason you're uncomfortable)"
48;720;Berlin;"At or before starting time for the event, you'll be met on arrival at the door with a glass of Sekt (German sparkling wine), and assigned a VR headset.  For the first 15 minutes or so, we will discuss the use of VR, why it is a perfect learning tool for wine, and start drinking!  Cheeses will be paired with the wines to illustrate how flavors change when they work together.  The first wine typically comes with a generous amount of conversation and Q & A, and an explanation of just about anything wine or tech related that may arise.  The goal of the tasting is to provide each participant with their very own ""ah-ha"" moment, when wine becomes more than just white or red or sparkling.  At the end of our tasting hour, you will find yourself equipped with a new way to understand how your senses work together, a new skill, and more confidence when shopping for or ordering wine.  

This wine tasting is perhaps a microcosm of the city:  the intersection of tech, culture, fun, and new experiences.  We hope to entertain you and your friends soon in Berlin.  

Cheers!

56;728;Berlin;"We want you to be comfortable and have genuine fun with us, so we are inviting you to our home, right next to Alexanderplatz, at 9 PM. Our main goal of this experience is to make friends from all countries and cultures, so we would like to welcome you here for a few home made cocktails, to get to know eachother, while we also listen to some live music and discuss where to go next. 
  The schedule we have in mind is going to Friedrischain, at around 11PM and maybe hit one of the many bars in the area for another pre-club drink. Anyway, depending on factors like weather or your mood we would not mind staying more at our place and going from our home straight to the party. The drinks and the music are on us.
  At 12-1AM we move on to the club and we will go to one of the many eclectic venues of the area, which you will definitely love. We will not make any fake promisses about ensuring access to the party, but since we have never faced this problem with the entrance, have no worries. We should not face any language barrier issue either since one of us is also a native german speaker.

  From now on, it's up to you how long you want this experience to last, but we will stay and party with you until at least 2AM.
 In these few hours we hope to give you a taste of the nightlife in one of the most fun cities in the world.

 Hope to see you soon!"

Enjoy an afternoon in my beautiful Kreuzberg workshop hand-making a sterling silver ring or pendant. 

Using jewellers wax, you will hand-carve a model of your piece, which will be later cast using the age-old goldsmithing technique, Lost Wax Casting.  

I will start by demonstrating the steps & tool-techniques to help you bring your vision to life. I will show you examples of wax models and finished pieces. 

Then, you will sketch your ideas and decide on your design. I will be with you at each step, with advice and tips.

To begin, you will reduce the solid block of wax to the desired width with a jewellers saw and, if you are making a ring, you will form & size your piece using calipers and a ring mandrel. 

Then you will use hand files, saws & wax-carving tools to gradually shape, carve and refine your design. Perhaps it will be clean and smooth, or have unique markings or indentations, or maybe a intricately carved design.  

After the workshop, your wax model will be cast in sterling silver, and polished and finished by me, and will be available for pick-up within 1-2 weeks.

150;822;Berlin;Everybody takes photos nowadays, especially while traveling. But there's a distinct difference between snapping a quick shot of a landmark and carefully crafting a photograph. The goal of this photowalk through the center of Berlin is to provide you with the basic photographic skill set to capture some of Berlin's most iconic landmarks in the best light. The blue hour is when a city is most photogenic. It's the time of day when natural and artificial light are equally bright and complement each other perfectly. Did you ever wonder how to capture those cool light-trails or how to get a shot of a famous landmark without any people in it? Well, I will happily share all of the tips and tricks I use myself to capture cityscapes during the blue hour. After providing an overview of the technical aspects of night and cityscape photography, we will dive right into it, apply what we've learned, and test it in the field. This way you will not only end up with some stunning shots for your social media, but also with the knowledge to make your next city trip a photographic success, too.

Homemade, yes, without special machines, prepared as in so many houses in the world only with the moka machine and the french press. But you will be surprised, they look like as done by professionals. And then you will learn how to prepare them by yourself with some tricks and a lot of fun.

A revealing experience if you love good creamy coffee, but find yours at home disappointing. You will learn how to prepare coffee at home with heart, like a barista, and also how to recognize a quality coffee and how to keep it so that it doesn't lose its original flavor and aroma. 

Preparing at home the delicious coffees that you love will no longer be a mystery."

We'll use the river Panke to avoid city streets, as we snake our way along a historical greenbelt, exploring the lesser known historical sites, street art, and breathtaking views.

The 2.5 hour feel-good ""walking meditation"" begins at my anti-yoga studio (Ghost Yoga) just north of Berlin's city center. This entire experience is super casual, like who gives a f**k.

Different historical periods left their marks on Helsinki, however it is easy to miss these great works of world renowned architects (from Engel to Saarinen, from Aalto to Siren and Revell) in ordinary city tours.  We will start with the old center of the city, visiting Helsinki Cathedral and National Library of Finland designed by Engel, the most influential architect in Helsinki in the first half of 19th century.  We will  then visit 3 important works of world famous architect Alvar Aalto (Stora Enso HQ, Academic Bookstore and Rautatalo). We will continue with Eliel Saarinen's Central Railway station. On our way, we will stop by two important libraries, KaisaTalo (Anttinen Oiva) and Oodi (ALA) and I'll explain the unique library culture in Finland. Strolling through important buildings such as the Music Hall (LPR), Kiasma (Holl), Finlandia Hall (Aalto), National Museum of Finland (Saarinen), we will make up our way to The Rock Church (Suomalainen). On our return to downtown, we will head to The Glass Palace (Revell), Amos Rex (JKMM) and Chapel of Silence (K2S)."

8;1006;Helsinki;"This day trip starts from Helsinki and takes us to Porkkalanniemi; a scenic peninsula which reaches out into the midst of one of the world’s largest archipelagos.

Our walk begins on a forest trail leading to an open-rock area which is the first display of the many diverse areas Porkkala has to offer. This open-rock area will give us the opportunity to see what effects coastal weather has on the near-by forest. Pine trees that are used to standing tall and true are forced to grow into short disfigured trees which reach for the forest inland. 

In the spring, summer, and fall we will pass through Finland’s iconic forests to see ruins from of the Nordic bronze age; an ancient burial cairn or stone grave which has since collapsed. Shortly after we will find ourselves with a picturesque coastal view. There will be picnic tables to have a break and enjoy a picnic style lunch with coffee/tea. 

During the winter time, we will take a different path to a wilderness shelter where we will build a fire to warm up and prepare our lunch.  There will be plenty of time to find a quite area and relax on your own or sit by the fire and chat.

12;1010;Helsinki;"Walking through the forest after dark is a wonderful experience and will surely be an emotional ride for those who have never done it. Our imaginations tend to go into overdrive and before we know it old fallen trees and boulders start taking on the shape of lions, tigers, and bears!

Luckily, we do not have any lions or tigers in Finland… 

Fortunately for us we will have plenty of natural distractions to keep our imagination at bay. Sipoonkorpi National Park is home many nocturnal inhabitants. One of the most fascinating being the Eurasian eagle-owl with its activity focused in the first few hours after sunset.

Equipped with a professional guide and flashlights your journey will no doubt be safe! Our walk takes place on a very wide and well-maintained trail which is easy to navigate in the night. After a short walk (20 minutes) through the forest we will end up at the campfire location where we can drink hot juice and barbecue Finnish sausages.

After our campfire break and nightly exploring it is time to head back. We will walk back on the same path from which we came. This excursion is meant to give you a glimpse into the possibilities of camping and nature based activities possible in Finland after dark.

With me as your guide, you'll be shown the cream of the crop; we'll be covering my favourite vintage stores, from the thrifting style places where you'll find rare treasures for under 20 euro, to the more curated store . Some of these stores are so off the beaten track, you'd never know they were down that little alley way or street!

We'll be trekking through the centre of Paris and covering several quarters,  and we'll have time at each place to have a thorough look. I'll be on hand to offer up advice on styling, how to make a piece work and even where you can find the next treasure to go with it!

Please note: Vintage in Paris is mostly from 1960s through to the early 2000s. If you're interested in older vintage, please contact me before booking a tour.

It includes a lot of provocative symbolism (apologies in advance to women and left-handed people) and gore (including the medieval cure for blindness.)

Instead of names and dates, the tour focuses on the unique good stuff that guidebooks leave out. We'll walk through the Latin Quarter to see what went on during the halftime show of Paris' ancient gladiator fights before learning why the city has a street plaque honoring a pornographer. There's a former CIA post with a KGB lookout across the street and award winning bakeries. Banksy and lots of other graffiti, throwing carrots and a real unicorn horn are included as well. There are high brow insights (the symbolism of Gothic churches) and low brow laughs (some of the really nasty scenes depicted on those churches.)  

For insights into haute cuisine we'll see a designer cheese store and  learn how Paris restaurants keep prices down while also learning about French socialism (ask me about my food stamps) and betting on death for real estate bargains. 

No tour follows the same path as we'll let the wind and whim take us as they may. Included is a file of over twenty pages of affordable, hand-picked recommendations for enjoying Paris. I have a lot of fun doing these tours and hope to be contagious."

123;1176;London;"Hey guys! 

In this experience, we will be conducting night & day photoshoots in charming and scenic locations where famous films were shot. 

This is a cinema-themed experience so we'll not conduct a photoshoot in the traditional sense.

Instead of fashion-style portraits, what you will get here is mostly ""candid"" photos in the urban environment, the real Parisian life, the small streets, the cafés, the unseen corners that inspire filmmakers and artists... Behind each photo there is a film, a story, a legend! 

We'll not be recreating the movie scenes for the most part, but instead we'll create our own ""movie"". We'll play with the city lights, the sun and the shadows, the contrast, in order to create the most cinematic/atmospheric/moody portraits and scenes possible. 

No problem if you don't know how to pose, you don't have to. Just be yourself. Ideal for couples! 

This photoshoot will also allow you to discover movie locations, listen to stories and historical facts on the movies/locations and walk through some cool hidden spots you would probably not find on your own. 
The goal of this experience however is to capture the best photos possible!

**CONTACT ME if you don't see the date you are looking for!

**PRIVATE SESSION starts from 198e for 1-2 persons, to book it find a date that has 4 spots left (or contact me) and click on ""Book as a private group""!"

What if there was another way ?
I will give you the main keys on how to read architecture yourself, the main styles of the city and how to decrypt them yourself, long after the end of the visit.

The tour will last around 2.5 hours and during that time we'll see and discuss more than thirty works ranging from the ""must-see"" pieces, a few hidden gems, a few really strange works, and the works I feel you will enjoy based on your background/interests. The tour will really focus on the stories and symbolism behind the work and the untold scandals and personal histories of the artists who created them with particular focus on the more underrepresented queer and female artists. We'll take time to discuss the experience and struggles of women artists like Maria Blanchard, Sonia Delaunay, and Ángeles Santos in a typically male dominated art-world. We'll go into detail about Dalí and his intimate relationship with the famous poet Federico García Lorca and how their partnership gave rise to some of the most famous paintings and poetry in Spanish history.  We'll spend a significant portion of the tour discussing Picasso's Guernica and how the rise of Fascism changed the course of what we now call ""modern art""."
55;1311;Madrid;"Cañas & Tapas. These two words sum up the “aperitivo” culture in Madrid perfectly. Our creamy beer is only achievable through what we call “Tirar la caña” which literally means pouring away the beer. This ancient way of drinking is unique in the world, but careful, not everyone can serve a good caña, and thats what I am here for!

I am a professional trained chef that decided to change pans and fires for the world of beers, wines and people, and I ́m not going to lie, it's one of the best decisions of my life. Now I have the palate of a retired chef, the nose of a sommelier and the communication skills of a natural born entertainer

I am really keen on sharing my knowledge and learning with you guys, because us Madrid locals believe that for a Cañas & Tapas experience to be great, conversation and laughter are actually just as important as beer and food!

But don´t worry, the food we will try is carefully selected from the best and not always most accesible places, at the end of the day the center is full of tourist traps, so rest at ease, we won´t be falling for any of those. 

As I am not always available, please check the established dates and choose your own. If you can´t find the date you are after, just send me a message.

57;1313;Madrid;"We’ll meet at Planet Club, next to Plaza Santa Ana, one of the most centric squares of Madrid.

58;1314;Madrid;The tour lasts between 2.5 and 3 hours. We will visit some very well known sites and also hidden gems. I try to go deeper in the history of Madrid to highlight the singularities, triumphs and failures that define the Spanish heritage, character, art, literature and culture. My goal is to explain what these historical sites mean and tell us about the city and the Spain of today. From the Islamic times and the early “Christian” Madrid, to the capital of an empire and then the struggles of the “Romantic Madrid” of the XVIII and XIX centuries that ended with the tragedy of the Civil War and the Franco regime. It’s a story with a happy ending with the arrival of democracy and fredom! I hope that at the end of the tour you will get to see some meaningful places, appreciate the personality of the city and its inhabitants and also have an overview on how Madrid and Spain became as it is, with its wonders and shadows.
59;1315;Madrid;"Madrid is full of myths and legends but only some of them have a real background. Together we will examine a house of a merchant of that period(medieval Madrid), a small palace, a museum and much more and we will examine the historical context of the period and how this environment created the myths of modern Madrid.

Together we will walk for 2 hours in the heart of Madrid and we will examine the myths and legends of the city. Haunted buildings and hospitals, streets with history hidden inside their name, and we will discuss the most popular urban legends of Madrid and Spain.

As they say, where is smoke there is fire so we will examine the historical context of the myths and we will try to break them down. Every one of them has more than one version so together we will examine what is the spectrum we use to interpret with legends.

During those 2 hours, we will be in continuous movement and we will start from the heart of the city the Puerta del Sol and we will finish in Plaza Mayor. We will make in total 6 stops to talk about legends and we will make as many as you need if you want to get rest."

This isn't a run-of-the-mill kind of tour from a typical travel agency, but rather a cultural and intellectual exchange whereby we visit some places of interest, both touristic and non-touristic, and share our perspectives on Oslo, Norway and life in general.

11;1553;Oslo;"A long time ago, in a city far, far away there was a town, boastfully established by the mighty Vikings, called Oslo. People were fair, they ate nothing but fish and sang from the fjord tops… okay, maybe there were other things too. Jump forward to the 1600s, and fire sweeps through most of the city. Jump forward again, this time to the 2000s and what was once the town centre of Oslo is now Gamle Oslo, or “Old Oslo.” Today the city has been moved, and you find yourself outside the Nobel Peace Center, looking at the boats that come in and out of the harbour.

We’ll walk along the main pedestrian street, Karl Johans Gate, just like Norwegians do on May 17th (Constitution Day); we’ll give a salute to the great Norwegian scriptwriters at the National Theatre; and appreciate the power and force of the fortifications at Akershus Fortress, not to mention the fantastic view! 

We hit the hot spots of Oslo, as the excitement crescendos to reveal the creme de la creme: the view of the Oslo Opera House. Appearing to rise out of the fjord majestically, the Opera House leads the way in an age of exciting new design. Oslo is thriving - you can feel the enthusiasm in the air. It’s THE place to be"
12;1554;Oslo;"Picture a river, surrounded by old manufacturing buildings and parklands.

You come across a giant chandelier, where around the corner hides a number of old wooden houses from the 1800s and facades covered in street art. Where in Oslo are you? You’re in the district of Grünerløkka, Oslo’s trendy and bohemian inner-city neighbourhood.

During your journey through Grünerløkka, where there is plenty of hipster vibes and history to go around (aka hipstoric), we’ll dig into one of the treasures that are Oslo. We'll see Damstredet, where you’ll want to take a photo of the lovely hillside houses. We'll also check in with Norway's dynamic trio: Ibsen, Bjørnson and… at the Our Savior’s Cemetery.

The area is also home to one of Norway’s most famous artists, none other than Edvard Munch (third person in the trio above of course). We end our hipstoric walk at Mathallen in the recently built, sustainable area of Vulkan."

These may be followed by wander time and/or sit spot. The walks end with a tea ceremony, sharing tea made from foraged local plants, possibly reflecting on the experience.

Why would Winston Churchill, over a century later, refer to Napoleon as Napoleon the Great? Because he measured what Napoleon did as a Head of State to save an entire Nation at its most critical stage.

Travel back in time and understand how Napoleon became a general at the age of 24, then rose to power and ultimately crown himself Emperor at Notre Dame!

On this journey, I will take you where Napoleon saved the French revolution; where he married Josephine, the love of his life; where he took her to dinner; and where he worked to reinvent and modernize France… 

You will get a glimpse of Napoleon’s vision as a Head of State and the imprint he left on Paris’ architecture.

I am looking forward to helping you discover the most captivating figure in French history!

• WHO IS THE PARISIAN?
She is bold, defies the codes of society without any aggressiveness. She was the first to wear pants and color her lips red when color was not recommended.
She builds her femininity in an almost intellectual way.
With Sophie Marceau, Marion Cotillard, Inès de la Fressange, nothing is forced or exaggerated, the whole gives off a natural elegance, crowned with a je ne sais quoi with undeniable charm.

• WHAT IS PARISIAN MAKEUP?
It's being made up without appearing to be made up, the ""No Make-up Make-up"":
- Know how to make up your complexion transparent to see moles, freckles. Highlight the areas of the face to capture light.
- Use the blush to lift the cheekbones.
- Bring out your eyes with subtlety.
- Highlight your mouth for an ultra sexy melted effect.

It is an effective beauty treatment but not too sophisticated.

Tout au long de la promenade, les différents lieux et aspects de l’Occupation de Paris seront abordés. En premier, les circonstances de la défaite puis la vie quotidienne sous l'Occupation. Mais aussi la Résistance aussi bien que la Collaboration politique ou économique dans de nombreux secteurs d’activité, des boutiques de luxe, de la banque ainsi qu’à la Bourse, et d'autres plus inattendus. 
La visite fera également la lumière sur la situation des Juifs, du nouveau statut décrété en Juillet 1940,  aux rafles et aux déportations.
De l’Opéra jusqu’aux Grands Hôtels de la rue de Rivoli, les principaux bâtiments réquisitionnés par les Allemands seront présentés. Une fois de plus, des anecdotes surprenantes alterneront avec la grande histoire.
Finalement, le secteur de la place de la Concorde, sera l'occasion d'aborder la Libération de Paris grâce aux nombreuses traces et anecdotes qui s'y attachent."
339;1924;Paris;"Picture this…

You’ll enter my lovely, warm, plant-filled home studio. We’ll get comfortable and talk about your design over an aromatic cup of specialty tea. 

Then, under my guidance, you will create personalised, delicate sterling silver jewelry with your own hands!

You'll learn goldsmithing techniques such as saw piercing, filing, sanding, drilling and surface treatment. I’ll only perform the trickiest parts of the process—or any part you’re not comfortable doing yourself.

You’ll practice cutting metal until you’re confident before sawing out your actual pendant from sterling silver. You’ll perfect the edges using special jeweler's files and sandpaper. We’ll drill into the pendant to attach the chain. Based on your preference, I’ll either polish your pendant to a high shine finish, or you’ll abrade it with pumice powder for a matte finish. We’ll assemble the bracelet/necklace with a clasp and ensure it fits perfectly. Finally, you’ll watch as I solder the links closed so the piece is strongly constructed and secure.

You’ll put on your finished piece… and we’ll take photos for you to share.

Now your creation will last a lifetime, to treasure and pass on to loved ones!"

9;1972;Prague;"Are you sick of ""umbrella tours"" and crowds? We are, and that is why we started this :)

Let’s say you only have a short time to spend in Prague and want to get the most out of your visit. See both important touristy locations, but also the less crowded, more hidden, unknown parts of the historical area. ❤️

Our goal was to come up with the top 3 hours experience in the streets of the most beauty-packed part of Prague, districts called THE LESSER TOWN & HRADCANY - just across the bridge from often crazy busy Old Town. We consider this side more special, it’s calmer and where even locals like to spend time! It dates back to the city foundation and now happens to be the main governmental and embassy area surrounding Prague Castle.

We dislike the cold, boring, monotonous “30px & monologue” type tours with no personal approach. Therefore, we decided to do city tours our way - we stay in smaller size groups and have fun, tell you about local history, life in Prague, what’s great to visit more in depth + other valuable recommendations for the rest of your stay here. Just anything you want to know, so you can have the best possible time here.

We include two stops with free local beers/drinks (2x) and local food tasting during the experience.

We do this all year and yes - enjoy no matter what season ☀️❄️

It's home cooking at its finest - nothing pretentious, but prepared with love.  It's a mix of traditional and creative - always seasonal and varied.  On cold days I might make a lentil and spelt soup with a salad of rucola, walnuts, apple and pecorino cheese.

Here you can go underneath the church to discover the tiny chapels adorned by the human bones of 4000 monks that were buried here from 1500 to 1870. Notice how the bones are displayed in a decorative way, making the crypt a real piece of art.

It is  a ring road of 50 km ca (more or less) , that allows you to visit some very beautiful areas of Rome, some very well known as for example the Colosseum, others less known, such as the popular district of the Quadraro and Tor Pignattara Tor Fiscale.

At this time, the winding corridors and stunning chapels are near-empty, allowing our group to explore in the peace and tranquillity that the great Catholics of history intended.

We’ll begin at the Vatican Museum, a labyrinthine complex featuring over 1000 rooms that cover a jaw-dropping four millennia. Those visiting unguided often find themselves dazzled by the work on display here – which can make it somewhat difficult to navigate. But we have curated a bespoke route through the museum that packs in all the best bits – without leaving you lost for hours in its maze-like corridors.

Our next stop is the world-famous Sistine Chapel, best-known for its sprawling ceiling art painted by Michalengelo. This seminal work is said to have changed the course of Western Art – which may sound a tad dramatic, but trust me: when you see it, you’ll believe it. The rules dictate silence upon entry to the chapel, which isn’t usually a problem – it’s sheer beauty leaves most speechless.

258;2511;Rome;We can read Rome in a number of ways: in its plan, in the buildings that make its streets and public spaces, in the skyline. During this walking tour you will learn how to “read” Rome, an ancient city, reborn in the fifteenth century and reshaped substantially in the following three centuries. You will discover how Renaissance and Baroque Rome’s urban form, art, and architecture projected the city’s image of itself to its citizens (URBI) and the world (ORBI). Popes, architects, scholars and sculptors invested in Rome a variety of narratives that strove to explain the city’s history, convince its citizens and visitors of its harmony, and exhort society at large to share in and shape its destiny. The city that resulted became a destination for pilgrims and Grand Tourists, and still is today. The tour is organized around three themes—the city and memory, the city as reliquary, and the city as theater. In uncovering some of the meaning of Rome, you will be equipped with the skills necessary to consider how our own cities and communities are, or could be, meaningful.

260;2513;Rome;We will learn how to roll out the dough, consisting solely of flour, water and eggs, by hand. We won't make use of any machinery. A rolling pin, a pastry board and the desire to get our hands dirty, should do the trick. During the lesson we will taste some biological extravirgin olive oil to give you the opportunity to become acquainted with this essential ingredient of italian cuisine.

261;2514;Rome;"在大约3.5小时的游览中（一般为日落前3.5小时开始，日落时分结束），大家将跟随我与Matteo一起走进这个浓缩了2800年罗马史的平民区，除了历史轶事之外，我也会详细讲述罗马各种令人匪夷所思的传说和意大利传统艺术形式（湿壁画、马赛克等）的制作方法，而Matteo会向大家介绍他在这个街区成长的趣事与罗马的民俗文化。旅程中主要途径的景点如下：

1 圣玛利亚大教堂与同名广场 （Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere）
穿过曲折狭窄的巷子，眼前忽然开阔。相传，这座圣殿是罗马第一个举行弥撒仪式的地点，也是第一座献给圣母玛利亚的教堂。它的历史可以追溯到基督教还没有普及的公元3世纪，如今我们所看到的是12世纪重建后的面貌。同样古老的还有广场上的喷泉，古罗马时代它就已是一个取水口，布拉曼特与贝尔尼尼两位大师给予了它今日的外观。

2 西斯托古桥与台伯河沿岸 （Ponte Sisto）
台伯河，代表了罗马的灵魂，但同时也带给这座它孕育的城市无数的灾难，西斯托古桥就是最好的历史证明。在2000多年的历史中，因为洪水的缘故，它不断地经历坍塌、修复和重建。在还没有筑起河提的年代，人们通过观察桥身上那个被称为 “罗马之眼”的圆环来判断水灾的来临。

3 伦加拉街（Via della Lungara） 
一条古老的街道，古罗马时期它是帝王花园与法外之地的交集，中世纪时期它是通往圣彼得大教堂的朝圣之路，文艺复兴时期它是达官贵族们修筑别院的钟情之处。塞维鲁城门、猞猁之眼国家科学院、法尔内西纳别墅、天皇后监狱，它们代表了一个又一个重要的历史片段。

3 拉斐尔情人的故居 （Casa della Fornarina）
也许你没有听过她的名字，但你却很可能在拉斐尔的诸多作品中见过她的脸庞。他年纪轻轻就已是那个时代最受追捧的艺术家，而她，玛格丽特，只是平民区中一个面包师的女儿。如今，她曾经住过的房子依然竖立在那个巷口，遥望着他在一街之隔的宫殿里所留下的绝美画作。

4 布拉曼特礼拜堂（Tempietto del Bramante）
艺术史的必修课，教科书中的经典，文艺复兴理念的完美展现。整个建筑的中心直指圣彼得殉难十字架的所在之处。布拉曼特，这位曾参与设计圣彼得大教堂的建筑大师一生作品无数，然而这座小小的八角形礼拜堂才是其最有影响力的代表作。

5 宝拉喷泉（ Fontana dell’Acqua Paola）
曾经看过穷游锦囊的一个提问“你有被一张图片种草而前往一个旅行目的地的经历吗？”，某位驴友的回答就是这座出现在《绝美之城》第一幕中的喷泉。尽管比起著名的许愿池而言，它是朴素的，但是它依然足够令你难忘，因为它竖立在山巅之上，面对的是整座永恒之城。

6 贾尼科洛山丘观景台（Terrazza del Gianicolo）
每到夕阳西下之时，总会有一些当地的爱侣来到这里，他们挽着手漫步在山顶的林荫大道，安静地欣赏着落日的余晖洒在鳞次栉比的屋顶上。而对于游客来说，在270°的观景台上面对壮观的罗马全景，细数白天走过的路、参观过的景点不失为一种有趣的体验。"
262;2515;Rome;"Please join me for a personalised farm to table experience at the Nesta Brother's deli just a few steps away from the Vatican Museum & St. Peter's Square. 

Learn about Italy’s old-world food and wine culture while indulging in the farm families unpasteurized artisan cheeses made from the milk of their semi-wild cows and sheep. The Nestas have won awards for having the highest quality cheese in the Province of Rome.

Your guided lunch or “happy hour” will include 4 different kinds of pasta filata (cheese that is made from stretching fresh curds in warm water), aged pecorino (sheep cheese) paired with chestnut honey, Porchetta (a roasted herb infused pork from a 2,000+ year old recipe), Prosciutto Crudo (ham aged for 1 year), Lonzino (baby back rib salami), a simple farmer's salami with hot chilli peppers, salami ""Sausage"" with wild fennel & Coppa di Testa (an excellent example of Roman cuisine.) Dessert will be award winning ricotta paired with 0-km fruit preserves; It sounds too simple (as I drool on my laptop) but it's better than gelato!  These traditional and innovative recipes will be accompanied by Sangiovese and Trebbiano wine, made from ancient grapes indigenous to Central Italy & artisan bread made from grains that the Nesta's have grown themselves.

Walk with me learning how a collection of simple twists of fate evolved into significant historical figures who helped shape Stockholm (and Sweden) culturally and politically. Beginning at the geographical center of Stockholm we walk through cultural history from 1611 - today! Amazingly every story connects together. Anything you want to know about Stockholm and Sweden this is the perfect forum to ask. 

This is a light-hearted story of Stockholm written over 5 years to give you an entertaining overview of modern Swedish history. Along the way we see local inner city living - Stockholm style.

Some of these places and stories are unknown to locals as well.

Comenzaremos con los primeros pueblos vikingos en el año 793 y cómo se llega a fundar la ciudad en 1252. Continuaremos con todos los problemas que ocurren tras la union Kalmar y los enfrentamientos con los daneses, en distintas estatuas escondidas en la ciudad. El paseo que realizamos está diseñado para que tenga congruencia histórica y cronológica, puesto que así es mucho mas impactante.

No sólo fotos de la ciudad durante el dia a dia, sino cuando la ciudad está congelada a -20ºC, fotos con el dron, incluso fotos de las auroras. Para poder enseñar todo esto llevo mi Ipad de 13 pulgadas, en el que enseño los videos mas interesantes.

73;2769;Vienna;"You will plunge into the world of formerly homeless Ferdinand, who has been hit hard by fortune. Born and raised in the 16th district Ottakring, he will take you on a tour full of witty anecdotes, tragic memories and insightful contemplations.
Ferdinand spent three years of his life in inadequate living conditions. During these years he has accumulated a wealth of knowledge he now shares on his walks through his home district. He shows places that offer free food and clothing, spots where you can use the toilets unnoticed or where you can warm up your bones. The tour halts outside the house in which he tended to his sick father and in front of a police station, where Ferdinand reflects on possible run-ins between the law and the homeless. Additional stops are a furniture shop and a retirement home, whose inhabitants always had some odd job for Ferdinand.
His moving story teaches us that anyone can become homeless, that there is always a way out and a path to go on. Please be patient with Ferdinand as he is not fluent in English and might sometimes need a moment to find the right words.

Then we wander off through the awesome Vienna Woods. There are flat or steep paths we can chose, or we head up a mountain to a rock climbing place with exhibition, viewing platform and lovely hut to have a break. Back at the barn the horses get some treats and we enjoy the lovely view at a wonderful herd of horses while we treat ourselves to some refreshments.
86;2782;Vienna;"We start our hike on an easy forest road with amazing views to Rax mountain, that we will climb. Soon, the forest road turns into a narrow, shady and steep trail. In the beginning, the trail is mostly in the forest, but after gaining some height, we will enjoy stunning views into the valley. 

The higher we climb, the more impressive the panoramas will be as a reward. After approx. 2,5 hours we will reach the plateau of the Rax mountain, having mastered 861 meters of elevation difference. We take a well-deserved break at the mountain hut (1.640 m), enjoying amazing views into the valleys, to the neighbouring Schneeberg peak and the vast plateau with its alpine flora.

Duration: approx. 4 hours 15 minutes
Elevation gain/loss: 861 m
Lowest point: 779 m
Highest point: 1.640 m
Distance: approx. 9 km

IMPORTANT: please only book this tour if you are an experienced mountain hiker and are familiar with alpine trails. You must have a very good physical fitness level. For experienced mountain hikers, I do not consider this hike difficult, for others it will be very hard and is not recommended.

87;2783;Vienna;"After a one and a half hours ride from Vienna, we reach the base camp of the nature park. We pay a small entry fee and start our hike. The first part of the trail is leading mostly downhill, passing by several waterfalls. Depending on season and weather conditions, they may carry more or less water. In spring there are many alpine wildflowers to admire. Most of them are rare and protected.

The rest of the path follows the river quite evenly on narrow wooden bars. Along the way, we find many stony and sandy beaches, perfect for a swim or a lunch break in the middle of nature. 1,5 hours later we reach the mountain hut, selling snacks such as sausages, sandwiches, beer and coffee.

After visiting the last waterfall we make our way back through a pleasant shady forest road. We take a scenic train to reach our starting point at the base camp (10-minute ride), before heading back to Vienna.

PLEASE NOTE: This is an alpine trail. You must be used to hiking alpine trails (rocky, stony, rooted terrain) and to steep ascents and descents. You should have a good fitness level to master this hike. If this does not apply to you, I strongly recommend choosing one of my other tour options.

*The entry fee of EUR 6,-- is extra and has to be paid directly at the base camp.

If you can't find your preferred date in the calendar, please contact me for further options."

After a short public bus ride back to our starting point, we continue our journey back to Vienna. The total travelling time from/to Vienna is approx. 2,5 hours.

I consider the hike of medium difficulty because of its length and elevation differences. The terrain is partly rocky and rooted (1/3) and partly easy forest road (2/3).

Vienna, the capital of Austria, is known for its rich history, from the classical music era to the Habsburg reign. Recently voted one of the most livable cities, Vienna is a city where you take your time and enjoy the breathtaking 18th-19th century architecture. Great for first-timers, our walking tour will take you through the pedestrian-friendly streets and parks of the old town."
94;2790;Vienna;"This workshop is a unique experience away from the typical tourist places of the city. In the beginning we will shortly talk about our project and how it all started. Then we will start with some easy steps to get into the music and rhythms of some dances and you have time to get used to move blindfolded. In the beginning it might feel strange, but you will see, after a while you will feel more relaxed and confident since the constant control of having to do something right is missing. 

We have studied many Latin dances in detail and filtered out their similarities and differences. This resulted in the ""1"", ""1-tap"" and ""3"" system, which deals with the weight change of the feet and their sequence. According to this system you can learn different dances very quickly and soon you can really get started. 

We also dedicate some time to the aspects of leading and following during the workshop. 
Those who can pass on and receive leadership impulses can experience dance as a harmonious dialogue. This is not necessarily limited to one's own role. Knowing the ""other side"" helps us to be more precise in leading or to be more sensitive in receiving leadership impulses. That's why we regularly let participants switch the roles during the workshop."
95;2791;Vienna;"For this complete photo session we will have a private location at our discretion, at least a model and a make up artist. We will discuss the crew in advance after booking this experience.

=> 20 mins >  will discuss the subject of the day, the model we are going to use => 20 mins > will explain the studio equipments (flashes, light camera, lenses) => 20 mins > we will introduce all the photo studio secrets behind a good exposure, the little details I keep in mind when I am creating a photo from an artistic point of view, the creativity part and the work flow I use from the moment the setup is ready until the moment you get to print your high resolution images. We will discuss the light (natural or artificial), we will discuss the equipment and the setup. 

90 mins > Together will photo shoot the model we have from various angles and on different setups. We will take the time later to look over the images we have created together and we get to pick the best of the best. Finally, we will apply a soft retouching using Adobe Lightroom and / or Photoshop. 

This is one time memorable experience in a private photo shooting in one of the most beautiful city in the whole world."
96;2792;Vienna;"After a good hour's drive from Vienna, we reach our starting point, the famous medieval village of Dürnstein. Its charm and the gorgeous landscape surrounding it will delight you. 

During our hike, we will enjoy fantastic views over the surrounding hills, the Danube, the castle ruins, and the village of Dürnstein. Inhale the air, filled with aromatic scents of the holm oaks, pine trees, rocks and wildflowers. Lean against the sun-drenched rocks and feel their power. This unique landscape has an almost Mediterranean touch and resembles the ones in Southern Europe.

Ascents and descents are steep in places and you must have adequate physical fitness. You must be free from vertigo and sure-footed. Please note that the path is very rocky, stony and rooted and can be slippery without the right shoes.

After having reached the highest point of the hike, we continue with the ascent through a beautiful landscape with holm oaks and interesting rock formations, until we reach the castle ruins, where the English king Richard Lionheart was imprisoned centuries ago. Walking time is approx. 3 hours, depending on individual speed.

We will visit the Christmas market in the Dürnstein Palace (Sat & Sun in December, optional) before heading back to Vienna.

117;2813;Vienna;"After a short ride from Vienna we reach the starting point of our pleasant 3-hour hike to the summit of Reisalpe (1.383 m), the highest mountain of the Gutenstein Alps. The highlight of this tour is that one can reach the top of the mountain within a short time (1,5 h). It is especially magical in spring and autumn.

In the beginning, the trail runs even along a forest road, after a while it gets pretty steep (mastering 450 metres of height), which makes reaching the peak even more rewarding. 

It is a lovely and diversified tour with a real countryside feeling in the Pre-Alps. Depending on the season, we can discover rare alpine wildflowers along the trail. We pass by charming mountain huts, pastures, mighty old trees, and cows. The highlight of this tour is an amazing 360 degree angle view on the summit where we will make a well-deserved break at the mountain hut before heading back to the starting point.

I recommend this tour to anyone who would like to try an easy mountain hike in the Austrian Pre-Alps.

123;2819;Vienna;"After a short ride from Vienna, we arrive at the ravine Steinwandklamm, where we have to pay a small entrance fee* and start our hike.  We wander through the romantic gorge by crossing wooden bridges and a little cave on top of it. 

From there we continue through a forest and to a plateau with a magnificent view of the Schneeberg, the highest mountain of Lower Austria. From the plateau, we take a quiet forest path until we reach the beginning of the Myra waterfalls. 

We follow the waterfalls for a while before climbing up a rather steep hill. After having mastered the sweaty ascent, we will be rewarded with a beautiful view from the summit into the valley and onto the surrounding hill chains. Our way leads us downhill and uphill again in gentle curves on a country road. We pass beautiful pastures and if we are lucky, may spot some cows or horses before we get back to the starting point.

124;2820;Vienna;"We do an exquisite and pleasant hiking tour, on the southern edge of the Vienna Woods on the old Via Sacra pilgrim path. Since this hike is following mostly panoramic trails, we will enjoy amazing views throughout the hike. The landscape is very idyllic with little farms, orchards, cows and horses. It resembles a bit ""the Shire"" of Lord of the Rings, so if we are lucky we might have an encounter with the Hobbits :) 

I consider this hike easy and anyone with an average fitness level should be able to master it. Hiking time is approx. 3 hours. Distance: 12 km. Commuting time from the meeting point in Vienna is 30 minutes (one way).

This hike is ideal for anyone who wants to explore the near countryside of Vienna, get out of the city, enjoy amazing views, inhale fresh air and enjoy some peace and quiet.
